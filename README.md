Brick breaker HTML5 game

### About this project
My little game project from Udemy online course ["Code Your First Game"](https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game). The game is created on HTML5 canvas and mostly javascript.

### How to run the game

### How to play

* If you can't catch the ball, the game reset.
* Bonus: The farther from the center of the paddle you bounces, the faster the ball moves.
